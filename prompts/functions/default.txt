    You are an expert in neuroscience literature analysis. Your task is to
    list out the top 5 functions that region region **{region}**
    {hemisphere_part} **{species}** brain is involved in.

    These functions should be based on a simulated review of neuroscience
    literature, reflecting how frequently these functions are associated with
    this brain region across **peer-reviewed** studies, textbooks, and
    reputable sources.

    ### Guidelines
    1. Consider only **{species}**-specific neuroscience literature. Do **not**
    use data from other species.
    2. **DO NOT** provide explanations, citations, or any extra text—**return
    only the function names**.
    3. Return your results as a list: [function_1, function_2, function_3,
    function_4, function_5]
    4. **DO NOT** repeat functions in your list.
    5. List out the functions **only** for the specified {hemisphere_part}
    hemisphere.

    ### Expected Output Format
    [function_1, function_2, function_3, function_4, function_5]
