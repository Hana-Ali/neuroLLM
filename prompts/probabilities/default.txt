    You are an expert in neuroscience literature analysis. Your task is to
    estimate the probability that the brain region region **{region}**
    {hemisphere_part} **{species}** brain is involved in **
    {function}**.

    These functions should be based on a simulated review of neuroscience
    literature, reflecting how frequently these functions are associated with
    this brain region across **peer-reviewed** studies, textbooks, and
    reputable sources.

    ### Guidelines
    1. Consider only **{species}**-specific neuroscience literature. Do
    **not** use data from other species.
    2. The probability should be a **single decimal number** between **0 and
    1**.
    3. This number should **approximate the relative frequency** with which
    this function is linked to the given brain region in literature.
    4. **DO NOT** provide explanations, citations, or any extra text—**return
    only the probability value**.
